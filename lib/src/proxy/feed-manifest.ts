 * Create a feed manifest directly using chunk upload
 *
 * Instead of using bee.createFeedManifest() which calls the /feeds endpoint,
 * this function builds the manifest locally as a MantarayNode and uploads it
 * via the encrypted chunk endpoint (or plain chunk endpoint if encrypt=false).
 *
 * Feed manifests have a single "/" path with metadata:
 * - swarm-feed-owner: Owner's ethereum address (40 hex chars, no 0x)
 * - swarm-feed-topic: Topic hash (64 hex chars)
 * - swarm-feed-type: "Sequence" for sequential feeds
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This function implements client-side "saveRecursively" logic:
 * 1. Upload the "/" child node first and get its address
 * 2. Set the child's selfAddress to the uploaded address
 * 3. Then upload the root node (which references the child's address)
 *
 * Without this, Bee's /bzz/ endpoint returns 404 because the "/" child chunk
 * doesn't exist (only its calculated hash was stored in the root manifest).
 *
 * @param bee - Bee client instance
 * @param stamper - Stamper for client-side signing
 * @param topic - Topic hex string (64 chars)
 * @param owner - Owner hex string (40 chars, no 0x prefix)
 * @param options - Options for creating the manifest (encrypt, etc.)
 * @param uploadOptions - Upload options (tag, deferred, etc.)
